    <h1>人生 - Night Nature</h1>
    <img src="img/night-nature.jpg" alt="Night View in The Middle of Forest">

    <p>I like Night Nature, because</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Calm Atmosphere</li>
        <li>Cool Air</li>
        <li>Silence of Darkness</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When I look at Night Nature photos, I feel like <strong>the atmosphere is calm</strong> and I hoping "I want to go there". I love night, because it feel cold and there is no noisy. Maybe <em>my statement is not valid if you are in big city</em> like Surabaya or Tokyo, that's why I choose forest for the photo.</p>

        I also love the view of cities in the night. The glowing building shine in the middle of the night. I start to thinking why the city is not fell asleep? Are the people stay awake for 24 hours everyday?

        When I write this article, I start to imagining myself live in Tokyo, one of the most populated city in Earth. I hope I can live there one day. Find my love, Japanese wife and start my live with my little family.
